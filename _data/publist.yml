- title: "Efficient emulators for scattering using eigenvector continuation"
  image: EC_parameters.png
  description: Eigenvector continuation (EC), which accurately and efficiently reproduces ground states for targeted sets of Hamiltonian parameters, is extended to scattering using the Kohn variational principle. Proofs-of-principle imply EC will be a valuable emulator for applying Bayesian inference to parameter estimation constrained by scattering observables.
